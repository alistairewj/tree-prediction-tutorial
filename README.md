Tutorial on prediction of medical data using tree based models

## Setting up the environment

Most requirements should be met with a simple pip install:

`pip install pydotplus numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib jupyter`

If you want the exact version of all the packages, you can use the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the notebook

The `trees-classification.ipynb` should run out of the box. The first cell is used for running the notebook on [Google's Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).
